								<p class="lead">Hello, my name is Rica Feng and I'm primarily a game programmer and designer. My skill set includes Unity3D, C#, C++, 3D modeling, music composition, tutoring, and general game design. My goal is to better myself in these areas and contribute new and interesting software.
								<br><br>
								In University of California Riverside on 2013, I founded a student organization dedicated to teaching students about the intricacies and challenges of video game development.

										<h4 id="proj-genre">Management</h4>
										<p id="proj-pitch"> Score as many points as you can in five minutes by dragging combinations of ingredients to create recipes.</p>
										<p id = "proj-description">	Created in 42 hours with one other artist for Mark Brown's Game Maker's Tool Kit Game Jam. I handeled all programming tasks including the game's mechanics, progression, and score system. Information on the theme is located <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam" target="_blank">here</a>.
										Our design goal was to create a simple mouse only game that is easy to pick up and learn, but still have some complexity after learning the basics.
										For example, placing ingredients so that they reduce the amount of time between dragging items is essential for getting higher scores, but new players need not concern themselves with it yet. Another design goal was simple and clear UI. For example, cooking timers are represented by "steam" instead of fillable bars.<br>
										<br>
										To score points, you must first grab new ingredients from the window and place them in your pantry, cutting board, or in a pot or pan. Avaliable recipes to complete are randomly chosen from a pool at random. Follow recipes by cutting and combining ingredients, and then putting them in a pot or pan to cook. Make sure the food doesn't burn! When you are done, drag your finished product to the window to score points.
										You get reduced points for finished products that don't match any of the current recipes. After finishing a correct recipe, the recipe will turn green and you may then tap it to get a new random recipe. The window refreshes all of its contained ingredients every 30 seconds, so make sure to grab the ingredients you want as soon as you can.</p>

										<p id = "proj-description">	Created with a team of two artists and two other programmers for Global Game Jam 2017 and the theme "Waves".
										I helped design and implement the hazard behaviors, controls, and simulated physics.
										To play, you will need a friend and two controllers.
										Use the left analog stick to move your cursor and the action button (for a Xbox360 controller, this should be A) to splash.
										Splashing causes a wave to appear, pushing away other entities. This is your main mode of duck transportation! You and another friend must then work together to try and push every duck into the drain.
										There are also four different ducks each with their own characterstics, and there are a plethora of other hazards such as urchins, faucets, and... whales? Yes, whales.
										Try to get through all 20 stages!</p>

										will instantly end the game. One feature: you can hold left click and then release to launch crates different distances, depending on how long
										you charged for. The enviornment also changes throughout the stages.</p>

										the right direction. When you start the game (after adjusting each turn tile pad), Snak will fire off and follow the direction of each turn tile pad it hits. If Snak hits a wall
										or hits its own tail, you must restart. For this prototype, there are 4 levels, with some levels having optional coins Snak can collect.

										randomly generated melodies and playing them back on a virtual piano. For each melody, you have a time limit where you must correctly play back the
										melody or else the game ends. After each correctly played melody, the time limit resets. Although there are levels,
										 the game is endless; Melody Matcher gets progressively more difficult after each successfully melody. Points are also dynamically calculated depending on
										 the difficulty of the melody and several other factors such as accuracy and length of time spend completing the melody. There are three
										 difficulties to choose from and selectable instruments. </p>
