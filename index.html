										<p id="proj-pitch"> Create waves in order to push all the rubber duckies into the bathtub drain.</p>
										<p id = "proj-description">	Originally, this game was created for Global Game Jam 2017, with the theme "Waves".
										Most of this game was created in Unity within 3 days, although this is a more polished build which was worked on after GGJ2017 ended.
										To play, you will need a friend and 2 controllers.
										The controls are simple: use the left analog stick to move your cursor and the action button (for Xbox360, this should be A) to splash.
										Splashing causes a wave to appear, pushing away other entities. This is your main mode of duck transportation! You and another friend must then work together to try and push every duck into the drain.
										There are also 4 different ducks each with their own characterstics, and there are a plethora of other hazards such as urchins, faucets, and... whales? Yes, whales.
										Try to get through all 20 stages!</p>

										<p id = "proj-description">This game was created in Unity for a job application, and development of this game spanned one week.
										I was given a framework to improve upon. There are 30 stages, and your goal is to launch a variety of different crates into hoops in order
										to score points and earn more time. The game is over once the timer hits 0. Missing crates will deduct time and falling off the center platform
										will instantly end the game. One feature: you can hold left click and then release to launch crates different distances, depending on how long
										you charged for. The enviornment also changes throughout the stages.</p>

										create different staircases for use in the editor. Nonetheless, you can create staircases with different stair lengths, widths, and heights and view that staircase using this application.
										You also have the option of bouncing a ball between each step. (It looks cool!)</p>

										<p id = "proj-description"> This game was created using Allegro, which is a C++ graphics library. Development of this prototype took around 5 days.
										If you haven't guessed it yet, this game is loosely based off Snake. In order to guide Snak (the snake) towads all the Stars, you need to turn tile pads and have them face
										the right direction. When you start the game (after adjusting each turn tile pad), Snak will fire off and follow the direction of each turn tile pad it hits. If Snak hits a wall
										or hits its own tail, you must restart. For this prototype, there are 4 levels, with some levels having optional coins Snak can collect.

										<h4 id="proj-genre">Music</h4>
										<p id="proj-pitch"> Playback randomly generated melodies to score points.</p>
										<p id = "proj-description"> This was a college web project that took around a month to complete. The goal of this project was to help players with pitch and tone recognition.
										Earn points by listening to 
										randomly generated melodies and playing them back on a virtual piano. For each melody, you have a time limit where you must correctly play back the
										melody or else the game ends. After each correctly played melody, the time limit resets. Although there are levels,
										 the game is endless, Melody Matcher gets progressively more difficult after each successfully melody. Points are also dynamically calculated depending on
										 the difficulty of the melody and several other factors such as accuracy and length of time spend completing the melody. Enjoy
										multiple difficulties and selectable instruments. </p>

								<p class="lead"> This is the section where I talk more about what I do in my spare time.<br><br>
								Besides creating video games, my other hobbies include guitar, the beach, anime, and playing board/card/tabletop games.
								<br><br>
								I ocasionally play League of Legends, Titanfall 2, and Minecraft, and my favorite game of all time would probably be Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.
								Other favorites are Red Dead Redemption, The Witness, Limbo, and FTL: Faster Than Light.
								I also have a great appreciation for games with built in level editors. Favorites in that regard that come to mind are Monaco and N++.
								<br> <br>
								When it comes to music, I listen to mostly Alternative, Indie, and Electronic. Examples include Elliot Smith, Beach House, and Kimbra. Especially Kimbra, she's amazing!
